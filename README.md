## Description:
Practice rails app to keep time on keyboard up. Application exposes a couple endpoints allowing users to save verbs, nouns, adjectives and insult formats in a PostreSQL database. User can then call on another enpoint to randomly fill a selected insult format with nouns/vers/adjectives to generate an insult. May include full crud functionality as further practice down the line, currently only includes create and read functionality for the DB resources.
